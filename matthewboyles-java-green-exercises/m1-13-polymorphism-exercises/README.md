# Polymorphism Exercises

In order to practice applying polymorphism, your task is to create interface definitions and class implementations for the exercises defined below. In any of the cases, you may add attributes (i.e. properties) and other supporting methods to the classes in order to fully implement the interface.

Each implementation class requires unit tests to verify its correctness.


## Postage
 
#### DeliveryDriver Interface

calculateRate( distance, weight)
    
#### Implementing Classes

##### Postal Service

The Postal Service "is-a" DeliveryDriver and bases the rate upon weight in ounces up to 1 pound, in pounds beginning with 16 ounces or greater

    |--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
    |        | 1st Class | 2nd Class | 3rd Class |
    | Ounces | Per Mile  | Per Mile  | Per Mile  |
    |--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
    | 0 - 2  |   0.035   |   0.0035  |   0.0020  |
    | 3 - 8  |   0.040   |   0.0040  |   0.0022  |
    | 9 - 15 |   0.047   |   0.0047  |   0.0024  |
    | Pounds |           |           |           |
    | 1 - 3  |   0.195   |   0.0195  |   0.0150  |
    | 4 - 8  |   0.450   |   0.0450  |   0.0160  |
    | 9+     |   0.500   |   0.0500  |   0.0170  |
    |--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|


    rate = per mile rate * distance

##### FexEd

FexEd "is-a" DeliveryDriver and charges a flat rate for all packages, but may apply extra charges based upon weight and distance

    rate = 20.00
    if distance > 500 miles then rate = rate + 5.00
    if weight > 48 ounces then rate = rate + 3.00

##### SPU

SPU "is-a" DeliveryDriver and follows a simple formula based upon class, weight (in lbs) and distance.

    If four-day ground then rate = (weight * 0.0050) * distance
    If two-day business then rate = (weight * 0.050) * distance
    if next day then rate = (weight * 0.075) * distance

#### Main


Following the approach that the morning's examples has led, create a List that represents a distribution hub and can calculate the shipping values for the various delivery methods so that the customer can make a safe and informed decision.


*Sample Output*

```
Please enter the weight of the package? 15
(P)ounds or (O)unces? O
What distance will it be traveling to? 340


Delivery Method                 $ cost
--------------------------------------
Postal Service (1st Class)      $15.98
Postal Service (2nd Class)      $1.60
Postal Service (3rd Class)      $0.82
FexEd                           $20.00
SPU (4-day ground)              $1.59
SPU (2-day business)            $15.94
SPU (next-day)                  $23.91
```




## Vehicle

#### Vehicle Interface Methods

calculateToll( distance )

#### Implementing Classes
    
##### Car

Tolls for cars are based upon distance.

    toll = distance * 0.020
    if pulling a trailer then toll = toll + 1.00
    
##### Truck

A truck "is-a" vehicle and the tolls for trucks are based upon the number of axles.

    |--------|-----------|
    | Axles  | Per Mile  |
    |--------|-----------|
    |   4    |   0.040   |
    |   6    |   0.045   |
    |   8+   |   0.048   |
    |--------|-----------|

    toll = rate per mile * distance
    
##### Tank

A tank "is-a" vehicle and all military vehicles travel free on the toll roads.

    toll = 0;

#### Main


Following the approach that the morning's examples has led, create a List that represents all of the cars that travel through a particular tollbooth. Using a random number for distance (10 to 240) calculate the tolls for each vehicle so that you can:

* indicate each vehicle, its distance traveled, and toll
* indicate the sum of all miles traveled and total tollbooth revenue


*Sample Output*

```

Vehicle          Distance Traveled      Toll $
----------------------------------------------
Car              100                    $2.00
Car              75                     $2.50
Tank             240                    $0.00
Truck            150                    $6.75
