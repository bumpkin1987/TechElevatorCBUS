# Project Organizer Database Access SOLUTIONS


## Part 1 (Day 1) - Data Access Objects

**Setup:** Create a PostgreSQL database using the attached SQL script `projects.sql`. 

Complete the CLI application for the project database by implementing the `JDBCDepartmentDAO`, `JDBCEmployeeDAO`, and `JDBCProjectDAO`.

## Part 2 (Day 2) - Integration Testing

Create a Unit Test project for the **Project Organizer Database** application. Implement integration tests for the `JDBCDepartmentDAO`, `JDBCEmployeeDAO`, and `JDBCProjectDAO` classes.

Be sure to clean up any test data so that the database is returned to its original state after the test is completed.
